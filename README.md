# **Eren Zhao**

## 个人简介

- 男，生于 2002 年 9 月 25 日，出没在北京西北部的五道口一带，未婚
- 世居川西北，半个成都生人
- 目前仍在华子大学上(zuò)学(láo)，投身人类社会观察运动，冬天每天都得卷到晚上 12 点，夏天每天 9 点睡觉，第二天凌晨 3 点左右出没在 C 楼三层
- 不抽烟，酒仅止于浅尝。睡前，一定喝一杯温牛奶，然后看 20 分钟的 TVB，上了床，马上熟睡，一觉到天亮，决不把疲劳和压力留到第二天
- 医生都说我很正常

## 个人爱好
- [读书](https://zhaochenyang20.github.io/categories/%E4%B9%A6%E6%91%98/)，[写作](https://zhaochenyang20.github.io/categories/%E5%BF%83%E5%BF%83%E5%BF%B5%E5%BF%B5/)，[看天下](https://zhaochenyang20.github.io/categories/%E5%8D%9A%E6%96%87/)
- 偶尔看番（进击的巨人，火影忍者，海贼王，寄生兽，东京喰种，双城之战..）

## 个人理想

- 由于本人相比周围众多大佬，仅有薄弱的数理基础，大概率难以从事神圣的计算机科学领域的科研工作
- 进一步考虑到自身日益发展的物质需求和落后拉胯的编程水平之间的矛盾，预计成为一个 program virtuoso 同样挑战巨大
- 考虑自以为尚可的交际能力，未来希望能从事金融量化等更需要和人打交道的工作
- 还有些不切实际的理想，譬如成为作家
- 一个[布尔什维克主义者](https://zhaochenyang20.github.io/pdf/%E6%88%91%E4%BB%AC%E7%9A%84%E4%BC%9F%E5%A4%A7%E4%B8%8E%E6%B8%BA%E5%B0%8F.pdf)

## 博客

- [博客](https://zhaochenyang20.github.io/)由 zhaochen20 在 2022 年寒假搭建
- 本意想向我的诸多好友学习，搭建技术博客，而后发现自己废话太多，博客里充斥着对人类社会的观察感想
- 博客主要记录着我的：
  - 学习心路
  - 读书笔记
  - 社工记录
  - 社会观察
- 在链接部分罗列了我的众多好友与诸多贵系上古大神的博客
- 卑微跪求给我的 github 来个 follow

## 教育情况

- 初中就读于马背上的学校——[成都市市实验外国语学校](http://www.cefls.cn/)，学习过三年少儿数学，初步发现了自己学不了文科，又学不好理科的悲惨事实
- 高中就读于成都数理化学校——[成都外国语学校](http://www.cfls.net.cn/)，有幸苟活于竞赛班并学习过两年的化学竞赛
- 目前不幸地有幸就读于[清华大学牛马工程与技术系](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/)——简称贵系。成绩平平，外貌感人，社工划水，科研摸鱼，脱单无望。正在退学的边缘苦苦挣扎，有望在众多好友精准扶贫之下于 2024 年喜提学士学位
- 如果地球不爆炸，理论上本人会在 2023 年春季前往加拿大滑铁卢大学交换半年
- 如若能有幸从你清毕业，初步考虑前往阿美利卡攻读硕士学位，而后留在丑国工(bǎi)作(làn)几年

## 社会工作

- 在贵系课咨委担任留任委员，主要负责和众多学长唠嗑，一同辱骂贵系
- 在华子大学答疑坊参与后台小程序开发，已经入职答疑岗位，希望能解决一些计算机相关学科的简单问题
- 有幸在贵系科协网络部技能文档小组写(zuò)文(kǔ)档(lì)
- 年年在华子大学的清洗母校活动里摸鱼划水

## Profile

- Male, born on September 25, 2002, unmarried and haunts the Wudaokou area in the northwest of Beijing.
- Living in the northwest of Sichuan, half a stranger in Chengdu.
- Currently still studying at Huazi University, participating in the human society observation movement, every day in winter has to roll until midnight.
- In summer go to bed at 9 o'clock every day, the next day around 3 a.m. on Building C Floor.
- Don't smoke, drink only to taste. Before going to bed, be sure to drink a glass of warm milk, then watch TVB for 20 minutes, go to bed, and fall asleep immediately. Never leave fatigue and stress until the next day.
- The doctors said I'm normal.

## Self-commitment

- Because I have only a weak mathematical foundation compared to many bigwigs around me, it is probably difficult for me to engage in scientific research in the sacred field of computer science.

- Taking into account the contradiction between its growing material needs and its backward programming level, it is expected that a program virtuoso will be equally challenging.

- Considering the communication skills that I think are acceptable, I hope to be able to engage in financial quantification and other jobs that require more dealing with people in the future.

## About This Blog

- This site is built by zhaochen20 during the winter vacation of 2022.
- I wanted to learn from many of my friends and build a technical blog, but then I found that I was talking too much nonsense, and the blog was full of observations and thoughts on human society.
- The blog mainly records my:
  - Learn the way of thinking
  - study notes
  - Social worker records
  - Social Watch
- Listed the blogs of many of my friends and many ancient gods in the link section.
- humbly begging for a follow to my Github.

## Education

- Studied at the equestrian school at Chengdu – [Chengdu Experimental Foreign Language School](http://www.cefls.cn/), studied children's mathematics for three years, initially found that I could not study liberal arts, and could not learn science as well.
- Studied at Chengdu Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry School in high school - [Chengdu Foreign Language School](http://www.cfls.net.cn/), fortunately, lived in the competition class and studied for two years in the Chemistry Olympics.
- Currently, I am unfortunately fortunate enough to study at the [Department of Computer Science and Technology, Huazi University](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/). The grades are mediocre, the appearance is touching, the social work is paddling, the scientific research is fishing, and there is no hope of getting a girlfriend. Struggling on the edge of dropping out of school, it is expected that under the precise poverty alleviation of many friends, he will be offered a bachelor's degree in 2024.
- If the earth does not explode, theoretically I will go to the University of Waterloo in Canada to exchange for half a year in the spring of 2023.
- If I am fortunate enough to graduate from your Qing, initially consider going to America to study for a master's degree, and then stay in the Ugly States to work for a few years.

## Social Commitment

- Served as a remaining member of the academic advisory committee of your department, mainly responsible for chatting with many seniors and abusing your department together.
- Participated in the development of back-end applets in the Q&A workshop of Huazi University, and already entered the Q&A position, hoping to solve some simple problems in computer-related disciplines.
- I am fortunate to write skill docs in the Skills Documentation Team of the Network Department of the Association for Science and Technology of your department.
- Every year in the cleaning activities of Huazi University's alma mater.
